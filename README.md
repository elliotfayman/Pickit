**Calling all hikers!** Turn your hikes into eco-adventures with PickIt! It's a gamified app that tracks your trash collection, transforming cleanup into a friendly competition. Scan trash, earn points based on its environmental impact, climb the leaderboard, and win prizes! Let's work together to keep our trails beautiful and healthy.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by fitness applications that motivate people through points and rewards. We saw an opportunity to apply this concept to environmental cleanup, empowering hikers to make a positive impact while enjoying the outdoors!

## What it Does

PickIt is a gamified hiking app that encourages eco-friendly behavior:

1. Scan Trash: Find trash on hiking trails and use the app to scan it.
1. Earn Points: Each scanned item contributes points based on its environmental impact.
1. Compete and Win: Climb the leaderboard and compete with other hikers in your local community for the most points and prizes.

## How We Built It

PickIt is built using the following technologies:

- **Reflex:** A powerful framework for building user interfaces.
- **Gemini:** This large language model helped us research the ecological impact of different types of trash to create an accurate scoring system.
- **MongoDB:** A flexible NoSQL database for storing user data, trash collection records, and leaderboard information.
- **Python:** A versatile programming language used for backend development and application logic.
